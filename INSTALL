INSTALL for pdfTeX 1.30.5
=========================

This distribution is a stripped-down version of the TeXlive distribution.
All source code is in the directory src; the script build.sh will generate and
populate a directory build.

The code of pdfTeX is in src/texk/web2c/pdftexdir and src/texk/web2c/pdfetexdir

Try the script build.sh in this directory. If it succeeds, you should end up
with the files pdftex, pdfetex, pdftex.pool and pdfetex.pool in build/texk/web2c

If you are using a TeX distribution older than 2005 (e.g. teTeX 2.x), please
first update your complete TeX installation.

Replace the so-named files in your TeX installation with these (if you are
using a recent distribution most likely pdftex is a symlink to pdfetex, so you
only need to install pdfetex and pdfetex.pool) and regenerate all formats of
your TeX installation (e.g. with "fmtutil --refresh").

If all else fails, follow the clues in README, src/texk/INSTALL and
src/texk/web2c/INSTALL.
