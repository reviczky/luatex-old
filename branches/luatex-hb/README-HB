Experimental branch to include Harfbuzz, after the 
commit r51270 of texlive:
2019-05-30  Khaled Hosny  <dr.khaled.hosny@gmail.com>

        * Makefile.am: Fix missing Unicode functions with
        HarfBuzz 2.5.0. Drop ICU dependency.
        * aclocal.m4, configure.ac, hbtest.c, include/Makefile.am:
        Drop ICU dependency.

This is an unofficial branch, hence  version  is 9.99.9, to avoid confusion 
with luatex tag/trunk/experimental. 
The goal is "add harfbuzz, keeping 100% backward compatible with engines if possible".

There is not a schedule, but roughly speaking in steps:

-1) Luatex compile, harfbuzz not even touched
0)  Luatex compile, harfbuzz too, but not linked
1)  Luatex compile, harfbuzz too, linked
2*)  Luatex compile, harfbuzz too, linked, and works ok.

(* means current step)

Test:
With a full TL 2019
and files from https://github.com/khaledhosny/harf
$> luatex -ini lualatex
$> luatex -fmt=lualatex.fmt  test-latex.tex

seems to work.

Also  
replacing luatex in a context standalone 
the luatex manual is compiled.


2019-06-21 :
Next step:
1) "small" luatex -- luatex with a "minimal" binding to harfbuzz (program size <10MB)
2) "big" luatex -- aka luahbtex, with full binding to harfbuzz (program size estimated  25MB)
