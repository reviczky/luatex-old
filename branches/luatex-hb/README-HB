Experimental branch to include Harfbuzz, after the 
commit r51270 of texlive:
2019-05-30  Khaled Hosny  <dr.khaled.hosny@gmail.com>

        * Makefile.am: Fix missing Unicode functions with
        HarfBuzz 2.5.0. Drop ICU dependency.
        * aclocal.m4, configure.ac, hbtest.c, include/Makefile.am:
        Drop ICU dependency.

This is an unofficial branch, hence  version  is 9.99.9, to avoid confusion 
with luatex tag/trunk/experimental. 
The goal is "add harfbuzz, keeping 100% backward compatible with engines if possible".

There is not a schedule, but roughly speaking in steps:

-1) Luatex compile, harfbuzz not even touched
0)  Luatex compile, harfbuzz too, but not linked
1*)  Luatex compile, harfbuzz too, linked
2)  Luatex compile, harfbuzz too, linked, and works ok.

(* means current step)
