I post a mac install package on
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=111040">sourceforge's
file release system</A>. There's a certain amount of pother involved in using
the file release system, but you get the file eventually.

    If you follow the
    <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=111040">link
    above </A>you will end up on a page showing many releases of FontForge for
    many systems<BR>
    in most cases you will want the most recent release.
  <LI>
    Then click on the executable package you want to download:
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The mac release will be called something like "FontForge-200xxxxx.pkg.sitx
    </UL>
  <LI>
    Then you have the joy of choosing a mirror site (pick one that's on the same
    continent you are) and click on the little icon in the download column
  <LI>
    Then you wait. After a bit you get another copy of this same page. After
    an even longer time your browser notices that you've started a download.
</UL>
<H3>
  <A NAME="install">Installing</A>
</H3>
<P>
Generally your browser will decompress the package after pulling it down,
and then start the install process itself.
<P>
If this doesn't happen, find the package (it's usually on the desktop) and
double-click on it.
<P>
The install will request your password (to make sure you have the right to
do an install on your machine, and then ask some innocuous questions, and
proceed to install.

</H3>
<P>
FontForge does not conform to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines. FontForge
never will. Don't expect it to look like a normal Mac Application. It doesn't.
<P>
Before you can start FontForge you must start the X11 server. You do this
by opening the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder and double
-clicking on X11. This will bring up a new menu bar, and under the Applications
menu you should find an entry for FontForge.
<P>
  <HR>
<H2>
  Before you build (on a <A NAME="src-mac">mac</A>)

<P>
You may also want to install the
<A HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</A> package which includes many
useful libraries (see the <A HREF="#Dependencies">dependencies</A> section
below for more info on this)
<P>
You must then start up a Terminal window (the Terminal Application also lives
in the Utilities sub-folder of the Applications folder) and be prepared to
type commands in that window (I know, it's very un-mac-like).
<H2>
  Building and installing from <A NAME="src-source">source</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  Obtaining a source <A NAME="src-distribution">distribution</A>
</H3>
<P>
There are two basic ways to obtain a source distribution. One is by downloading
an entire source tree from the web, and the other is by using the cvs utility
to maintain a source tree on your machine which will be as up to date as
possible. The former solution provides more stability, the latter provides
access to cutting edge bugs.
<H4>
  <A NAME="src-tarball">tarball</A>
</H4>
<P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338&amp;package_id=114328">Sourceforge's
file release system </A>will contain a tarball (a file with the extension
for .tar.bz2).
<P>
After you have downloaded one of these packages, either copy the tarball
to where you are, or move to the directory containing the tarball (I can't
provide explicit instructions here, because I don't know where your browser
put the file) and type (<SMALL>The "$" or "#" are example prompts from the
computer. Do not type them yourself</SMALL>):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>bunzip2 fontforge*.tar.bz2
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>tar xf fontforge*.tar
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cd fontforge-*
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
  from the <A NAME="src-cvs">cvs</A> tree
</H4>
<P>
cvs is a nifty set of utilities which allows concurrent access to a source
tree by many users. To set up your own (local) copy of the cvs tree (including
documentation), create a new directory, cd into it and type the following
(when it asks for a password, just hit return):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs1.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fontforge login
CVS password:
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs1.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fontforge checkout fontforge
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cd fontforge
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once you have established a directory you may update it to obtain the most
recent version of the source by typing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cd fontforge
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs1.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fontforge login
CVS password:
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs1.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/fontforge update
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You can also
<A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/fontforge/fontforge/">browse
the CVS tree</A> online. Or see
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=103338">sourceforge's description
</A>for more information (their information is out of date, the correct server
is cvs1.sf.net not cvs.sf.net), or read the
<A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/">CVS manual</A>.
<H3>
  <A NAME="src-Building">Building</A> &amp; installing it
</H3>
<P>
Now you have the source installed on your system and you should be positioned
at the top directory of that tree. You need to configure your package (this
is a little program that figures out how to use your system), and then build
it (do not type "$"):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>./configure
<FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>make
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<A NAME="su">Having</A> done this you will probably want to install what
you have built. This should be done as root:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>su

# make install

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
On the mac the process is slightly different:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
  More complicated <A NAME="src-installs">installs</A>
</H3>
<P>
The configure script allows you to turn off and on various features of fontforge
that might not be appropriate for your system. Type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>configure --help
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
for a complete list of options. Some of the most useful are described below.
<H4>
  Building fontforge without X
</H4>
<P>
If you don't want to install X11 on your system, you can use fontforge as
a command line tool which can execute scripts to manipulate fonts. FontForge's
scripting language is described in detail
<A HREF="http://fontforge.sf.net/scripting.html">in the section on
scripting.</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>configure --without-x
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
  Building fontforge to edit type3 fonts
</H4>
<P>
If you do want to edit PostScript type3 fonts, you can configure fontforge
to give you access to more drawing modes than are generally available in
fonts.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>configure --with-multilayer
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
  Building fontforge to edit device tables
</H4>
<P>
If you do want to create device tables (which allow you to fix up kerning
data at a specific pixel size) in OpenType fonts
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>configure --with-devicetables
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
  Installing FontForge somewhere other than <CODE>/usr/local</CODE>
</H4>
<P>
If you want to install fontforge in a different directory (say in /usr/bin)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>configure --prefix=/usr
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>
  Installing <A NAME="installing-documentation-cvs">documentation</A> from
  the cvs tree
</H4>
<P>
If you have a copy of the cvs tree on your system then you should be able
to type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE># make install_docs
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Again you will probably need to be root to do this install too. Use either
"su" or "sudo" as appropriate for your system (<A HREF="#su">see above</A>).
<H2>
  <A NAME="Dependencies">Dependencies</A> (external libraries/helper programs)
</H2>
<P>
FontForge tries to avoid hard dependencies. If a library is missing then
fontforge will (in most cases) be able to continue to run, it will just lack
whatever functionality the library provides. So if you don't need to import
tiff images, you don't need libtiff. If you don't need to hand SVG fonts
you don't need libxml2, etc.
<P>
If you want to do autotracing around character images you should also download
either

  <LI>
    Martin Weber's <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">autotrace
    program.</A>
</UL>
<P>
If you want to edit <A NAME="cidmaps">CID keyed </A>fonts you need these
<A HREF="cidmaps.tgz">character set descriptions</A>. (These were last updated
22-Dec-2004)
<P>
You might want this addition to FontForge's built in
<A HREF="Encodings.ps.gz">character set encodings.</A> Use FontForge's
Encoding-&gt;Load Encoding command to add these encodings to the Encoding
Menu.
<P>
With the appropriate libraries, FontForge can import png, tiff, and gif images
to act as character backgrounds for tracing purposes (FontForge can import
bmp and xbm formats without external libraries). With libxml2 FontForge can
read SVG fonts. With the freetype library FontForge will do a better job
making bitmap characters for you. libuninameslist provides standard unicode
names and annotations for unicode characters (it has been localized into
English and French)
<P>
None is required for the proper compilation/execution of FontForge, if the
libraries are not present they will not be used. (If the machine on which
your executable was build didn't have them, then you must not only install
the libraries, but <A HREF="#source">rebuild fontforge from source</A>) If
your machine doesn't have them and you want them they are available from:

  On the <A NAME="run-mac">mac</A>
</H3>
<P>
Before you start fontforge on the mac you must start the X11 server. You
can do this by opening the Applications folder, and then opening the Utilities
folder, and then double-clicking on "X11". (If you don't have X11 there then
refer back to the <A HREF="#Before">instructions for installing it</A>)
<P>
Having done that there should be a menubar with a menu labeled "Applications".
Click on this. There should be a "FontForge" entry in it. Selection FontForge
will start fontforge and bring up a dialog allowing you to open a font or
create a new one.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge does not normally
show mac resource fonts in this dialog -- however it can still open one even
it it isn't displayed. Simply type in the name of the file containing it.
(or, if you prefer, type a "*" in the textfield and then press the [Filter]
button. This should show you all files).
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge does not use
the Command key to invoke menu items. (Any use of the Command key is intercepted
by X11, so Command-Q will quit out of X11 (and abort fontforge), it will
not quit fontforge cleanly)
<P>
<FONT COLOR="Red"><STRONG>Caveat: </STRONG></FONT>FontForge was written assuming
the availability of a three button mouse. X11 simulates this by creating
a virtual three button mouse where the middle button is invoked by Option-Mouse
click and the right button by Command-Mouse click.
<P>
If the Applications menu does not contain a "FontForge" entry, you can add
one yourself:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Select Applications-&gt;Customize Menu
  <LI>
    Then press the (Add) button in the dialog that appears
  <LI>
    Double click in the left-most section of the blank line which just appeared
    and then type "FontForge"
  <LI>
    Press the [Tab] key and type "/usr/local/bin/fontforge"
  <LI>
    Press the [Tab] key again and type "f"
  <LI>
    Then press (Done)
</UL>
<P>
(You may also start fontforge from the command line here. Go to the Applications
menu and select xterm, and look at <A HREF="README-Mac.html#Starting">the
section after the next</A>.
<H3>
  Notes on the <A NAME="PATH">PATH</A> variable
</H3>
<P>
On most systems fontforge will install itself into <KBD>/usr/local/bin</KBD>
(that's the standard place for optional software), and this is not always
in the default search path for commands (grrrr). Which means you might have
everything properly installed, but nothing actually works from the command
line. If you see messages like <KBD>"fontforge: command not found."</KBD>
this has (probably) happened to you.
<P>
So what do you do?
<P>
You need to set the PATH environment variable so that it includes /usr/local/bin.
The value of the PATH variable is a set of directories separated by colons.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>echo $PATH
/home/gww/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/sbin
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Unfortunately there are two ways of doing this because there are two different
conventions used by unix shells. Type:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If the name of your shell is <KBD>bash</KBD> (as above), <KBD>ksh</KBD> or
<KBD>sh</KBD> then you want to type
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If the name of your shell is <KBD>tcsh</KBD> or <KBD>csh</KBD> then you say
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
But you'd have to do that every time you logged in. Instead you want this
included in the shell's initialization. Again there are two cases, for the
<KBD>bash</KBD> family of shells you want to edit the file
<KBD>~/.profile</KBD> while for the <KBD>csh</KBD> family you want to edit
the file <KBD>~/.login</KBD>. On a bash system the following command is generally
sufficient:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cat &gt;&gt;~/.profile
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
^D
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
(where <KBD>^D</KBD> represents control-D, obtained by holding down the control
key while depressing <KBD>d</KBD>. <BR>
And for the csh family you would type:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>cat &gt;&gt;~/.login
setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
^D
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <KBD><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge font.pfa font2.sfd font3.ttf font4.otf

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
will start fontforge looking at the fonts you specify on the command line.
It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps fonts (type 0 fonts based
on a type 1 dictionary) as well as truetype fonts, open type fonts and many
other formats.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge -new</KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
will cause fontforge to create a new font (in iso-8859-1 encoding)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge</KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse till you've found
a font file (or have created a new one).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <KBD><FONT COLOR="Gray">$ </FONT>fontforge -script script.pe fonts...</KBD>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This will invoke fontforge in a non-interactive mode, and have it run the
named script. Any further arguments on the command line will be passed as
arguments to the script and processed (or not) by it.
